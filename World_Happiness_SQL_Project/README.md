# Overview
This project explores the World Happiness Report 2019, a dataset containing social, economic, and wellbeing indicators for over 150 countries.
The goal is to analyse global happiness trends, compare countries across key metrics, and understand which factors most strongly relate to overall happiness scores.

The dataset includes variables such as GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and corruption perceptions.

## Key Insights
- Countries with strong social support systems consistently rank higher in happiness.
- Higher GDP per capita generally correlates with higher happiness, but with notable exceptions.
- Freedom to make life choices is a major differentiator between higher-ranked and lower-ranked countries.
- Healthy life expectancy shows one of the strongest positive relationships with overall score.
- Perceptions of corruption tend to drag down happiness rankings more than most expect.

## What I Improved
- Analysing a clean but meaningful real-world dataset using SQL.
- Writing queries that go beyond simple SELECT statements and produce useful insights.
- Thinking about global wellbeing and development indicators using a data-driven approach.
