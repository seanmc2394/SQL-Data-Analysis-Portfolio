# Overview
This project analyses a real-world bank marketing dataset from a Portuguese banking institution. The goal is to explore customer behaviour, evaluate marketing campaign performance, and identify factors linked to term deposit subscriptions.

The dataset includes customer demographics, loan information, contact methods, campaign history, and macroeconomic indicators.

## Project Structure

- **exploration_queries.sql** - Section 1 queries
- **behaviour_queries.sql** - Section 2 queries
- **campaign_queries.sql** - Section 3 queries
- **demographic_queries.sql** - Section 4 queries

## Tools Used
- MySQL Workbench

- Kaggle (Dataset origin)
<br>

## Key Insights
- Call duration appears strongly related to subscription likelihood.
- Some job types are significantly more responsive to marketing offers.
- Younger and middle-aged groups show different engagement patterns.
- Previous successful contacts (“poutcome”) correlate with higher subscription rates.
- Housing and personal loans show differing impacts on behaviour.

## What I Improved
- Working with a large dataset (40k+ rows) in MySQL
- Creating clean, well-structured SQL files for a project repo
- Performing real exploratory data analysis, not just simple queries
- Thinking about marketing performance through SQL metrics
